# minecraft-mods
A mod that adds new foods, plants, and trees.

Additions include:

- Strawberry and blueberry bushes (right-click to pick fruit)
- Palm trees with coconuts
- Redwood and pine trees (pine trees can drop cones)
  - Along with planks and pressure plates
- Orange, lemon, and lime trees (right-click to pick fruit)
- A few crafting recipes

Things I'm working onfor future updates:

- Other wood stuff like fences, buttons, doors, trapdoors, boats, etc.
- Some fixes to make berry bushes and fruit trees regrow fruit
- Currently also some crashes caused by ocean monuments for unkown reasons, will look into those
