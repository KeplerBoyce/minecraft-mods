# keplerfoodcraft
A mod by Kepler that adds new foods, plants, and trees.

Additions include:

- Strawberry and blueberry bushes (right-click to pick fruit)
- Palm trees with coconuts
- Redwood and pine trees (pine trees can drop cones)
  - Along with planks and pressure plates
- Orange, lemon, and lime trees (right-click to pick fruit)
- A few crafting recipes

Things I'm doing/thinking about for future updates (somewhat in order of most to least on my mind):

- Have yet to get new biomes to occur naturally
  - For this reason, only fruit trees (orange, lemon, lime) which spawn in plains biomes can be found in regular survival
  - Other biomes can be seen in the "Buffet" option menu when creating a new world
- More crafting recipes for the foods for sure
- Some fixes to make berry bushes and fruit trees regrow fruit
- Other wood stuff like fences, buttons, doors, trapdoors, boats, etc.
- Bananas are still a W.I.P
- Currently also some crashes caused by ocean monuments for unkown reasons, will look into this problem
  - They show up in the creative inventory but there are some bugs with placement and generation in world hasn't been implemented
- Originally had an idea for a cooking pot (similar to furnace but with multiple ingredients), but due to time constraints wasn't finished
- Potentially some updates to textures if I have the time to make them look nicer
